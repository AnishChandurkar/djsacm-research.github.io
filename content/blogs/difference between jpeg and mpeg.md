## JPEG

JPEG stands for **Joint Photographic Experts Group**. `.jpg` and `.jpeg` extensions are used to store images in this format. It uses a **lossy compression algorithm**, which means some of the image data is lost during compression.

###  Advantages of JPEG
- **Small file size:** JPEG images can be compressed to small file sizes, ideal for sharing over the internet or storing on limited storage devices.  
- **Widely supported:** Most devices and software can read and display JPEG images.  
- **High-quality output:** JPEG compression allows high-quality output images, even after compression.  
- **Adjustable compression level:** Compression level can be adjusted to balance file size and image quality.  


### Disadvantages of JPEG
- **Lossy compression:** Some data is lost during compression, reducing image quality.  
- **Limited editing:** Repeated editing can further degrade quality.  
- **Not ideal for text or graphics:** Text, graphics, or images with sharp edges can become blurry or pixelated.

## MPEG

MPEG stands for **Moving Picture Experts Group**. It is a standard used for compressing **digital video files**. Like JPEG, MPEG is **lossy**, but it is optimized for moving images rather than still images.  

### Advantages of MPEG
- **Small file size:** MPEG compression significantly reduces video size, making it easier to store and share.  
- **High-quality output:** Compression can produce high-quality video even after compression.  
- **Adjustable compression level:** Users can balance file size and video quality.  
- **Supports various resolutions:** MPEG supports resolutions from standard definition to high definition.  


### Disadvantages of MPEG
- **Lossy compression:** Some data is lost, reducing video quality.  
- **Limited editing:** Repeated editing can further degrade video quality.  
- **Complex compression:** Requires significant computing power.  
- **Limited support:** Some devices may not support certain MPEG formats, causing playback issues.

## Similarities between JPEG and MPEG

- **Lossy Compression:** Both JPEG and MPEG use lossy compression techniques, which means that they discard some information to reduce file size. This results in a reduction in image and video quality compared to the original content..  
- **Popular Formats:** Both JPEG and MPEG are popular formats used for digital content. JPEG is commonly used for still images, while MPEG is used for video and audio.  
- **Adjustable Compression:** Both formats offer adjustable compression levels, allowing users to choose between smaller file sizes or higher image and video quality.  
- **Widely Supported:** Both formats are widely supported by devices and software, making them accessible and easy to use for a variety of purposes.  
- **Standards-based:** Both formats are based on industry standards, which ensures interoperability and compatibility with different devices and software applications.
